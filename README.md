## ➕➖ Number Bubbles Calculator ➗✖️🟰

💯 Email 💯

The FUN Number Bubble Calculator was designed for a group of students who didn’t have smartphones or personal calculators to use during school exams. One student reached out asking if I could build a tool for him and his friends to help with quick math while testing. Since their exams are taken on a computer and each question allows 3–5 minutes, I added a game and timer to keep them focused and engaged between questions.
